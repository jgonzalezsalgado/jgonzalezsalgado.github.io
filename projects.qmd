    __Overview:__ <br>
    Developed an embedded C application to implement a 2D digital level, interfacing a triple-axis accelerometer with a microcontroller to measure tilt along the x and y axes.
    
    Designed and wired a complete hardware system on a breadboard, integrating a RED-V development board, LIS3DH accelerometer, and an 8×8 LED matrix.
    
    Processed sensor data and controlled peripheral hardware, calibrating accelerometer readings, converting tilt angles into discrete LED positions, and driving the LED matrix.

  <!-- Text wraps around image with larger, responsive font -->
  <p class="justify-text" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; font-size: clamp(18px, 2.5vw, 22px); line-height: 1.8;">
    __Overview:__ <br>
    Designed a multicycle RISC-V processor in SystemVerilog, creating a hierarchical architecture with a finite-state machine, datapath, ALU, register file, and unified memory adapted from a single-cycle design. 
    
    Validated processor functionality through simulation and waveform analysis, tracking key signals, and control states to ensure correct multi-cycle instruction execution. 
    
    Systematically debugged RTL using testbenches and predicted execution traces, identifying and resolving interface mismatches, and control signal errors, until the processor passed all tests.

  <!-- Text wraps around image with larger, responsive font -->
  <p class="justify-text" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; font-size: clamp(18px, 2.5vw, 22px); line-height: 1.8;">
    __Overview:__ <br>
    Constructed an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) used to retrieve temperature, pressure, and other signals in lake environments via the MCP9701 thermistor and MPX5700ASX pressure gauge. 
    
    Assembled a PCB containing the MCP6002 OpAmp to return output voltages that can be modeled and analyzed in LabView. 
    
    Also configured the thrusters, power regulation circuits, and user inputs with robust waterproofing considerations including wiring and motors.

  <!-- Text wraps around image with larger, responsive font -->
  <p class="justify-text" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; font-size: clamp(18px, 2.5vw, 22px); line-height: 1.8;">
    __Overview:__ <br>
    Manufactured a precision machinist hammer from clear oak, AISI 1015 steel, AISI 4340 steel, and nylon, adhering to detailed engineering drawings, dimensional tolerances, and safety requirements. 
    
    The project emphasized material selection, fit, and functional performance. Applied a range of machining and fabrication processes, including turning and facing on manual lathes, milling operations, tapping, and controlled heat treatment using industrial ovens to achieve specified mechanical properties and final dimensions. 
    
    I now serve as a Machine Shop Proctor, responsible for training and supervising new engineering students in the step-by-step hammer manufacturing process, ensuring adherence to technical standards and best practices.
