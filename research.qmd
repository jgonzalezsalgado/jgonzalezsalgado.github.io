    __Overview:__ <br>
    Designed and tested low-noise, field-deployable analog amplifiers for electropenetrography (EPG) to monitor feeding
    behavior of disease-vector insects, supporting agricultural and ecological research.  

    Developed microcontroller firmware and Python-based software to     acquire, process, and visualize high-sensitivity analog
    signals from insect feeding experiments.    

    Applied benchtop electronics skills including oscilloscopes, function generators, and power supplies to prototype circuits,
    optimize signal quality, and improve reliability for field deployment.

    __Overview:__ <br>
    Operated and programmed a large hexacopter drone carrying a custom (Xilinx FPGA) RF transmitter to calibrate and map a clear beam pattern of a ground-based radio telescope, modeling a software defined radio. 

    Developed FPGA-based software-defined radio system with Verilog and Python, transmitting and receiving GHz-wideband signals for DSP analysis via Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). 

    Configured hardware and software systems include drone flight control (PX4/Ardupilot) GPS synchronization, RF amplification, and Python--based data analysis/visualization.
