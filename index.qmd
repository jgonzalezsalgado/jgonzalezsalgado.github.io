Hello! I am Joaquin Gonzalez-Salgado, a rising Junior Engineering major at
[Harvey Mudd College](https://hmc.edu) interested in electrical and computer
engineering (with appreciation for mechanical engineering.)

I'm currently doing research developing an open source RISC-V verification suite
for the CORE-V Wally Processor under the
[Clay-Wolkin Fellowship](https://www.hmc.edu/engineering/engineering-fellowships/clay-wolkin-fellowship/).

I also work alongside the USDA as a hardware/firmware engineer focused on
creating low-noise analog amplifiers for monitoring insect feeding behavior as
part of the
[Analog Circuitry Engineering (ACE) Lab](https://www.hmc.edu/engineering/undergraduate-research-experiences/matthew-spencer-research-group/).
