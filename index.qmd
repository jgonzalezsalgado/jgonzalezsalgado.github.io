Welcome to my Engineering Portfolio! I am a rising Junior Engineering major at
[Harvey Mudd College](https://hmc.edu) interested in electrical and computer
engineering (with appreciation for mechanical engineering.)

I'm currently doing research developing an open source RISC-V verification suite
for the CORE-V Wally Processor under the
[Clay-Wolkin Fellowship](https://www.hmc.edu/engineering/engineering-fellowships/clay-wolkin-fellowship/).

I also work alongside the USDA as a hardware/firmware engineer focused on
creating low-noise analog amplifiers for monitoring insect feeding behavior as
part of the
[Analog Circuitry Engineering (ACE) Lab](https://www.hmc.edu/engineering/undergraduate-research-experiences/matthew-spencer-research-group/).

## Research & Fellowships {#research}
**RISC-V Microprocessor Vertification and Design**    
Developed familiarity with RISC-V microprocessor design, verification, and certification workflows through analysis of open-source CORE-V Wally architecture and RISC-V specifications.   

Worked with Python, SystemVerilog, and RISC-V assembly concepts to design tests, explore coverage metrics, and understand microprocessor verification methodologies. 

Applied instruction-set simulation, SystemVerilog simulation, and coverage analysis techniques to understand RISC-V specifications, debug test behavior, and evaluate microprocessor verification workflows.redo     

**Hardware Researcher, USDA: Electropenetography (EPG) Amplifiers**   
Designed and tested low-noise, field-deployable analog amplifiers for electropenetrography (EPG) to monitor feeding
behavior of disease-vector insects, supporting agricultural and ecological research.   

Developed microcontroller firmware and Python-based software to acquire, process, and visualize high-sensitivity analog
signals from insect feeding experiments.    

Applied benchtop electronics skills including oscilloscopes, function generators, and power supplies to prototype circuits,
optimize signal quality, and improve reliability for field deployment.   


**Physics Researcher, Drone FPGA Radio-Telescope Beam Mapping**    
Operated and programmed a large hexacopter drone carrying a custom (Xilinx FPGA) RF transmitter to calibrate and map a
clear beam pattern of a ground-based radio telescope, modeling a software defined radio.    

Developed FPGA-based software-defined radio system with Verilog and Python, transmitting and receiving GHz-wideband
signals for DSP analysis via Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs).   

Configured hardware and software systems include drone flight control (PX4/Ardupilot) GPS synchronization, RF
amplification, and Python--based data analysis/visualization.

## Work Experience {#experience}

**Machine Shop Improvement Proctor**  

Supervised safe operation of machining equipment (mills, lathes, bandsaw) by student users, ensuring adherence to shop
safety protocols and best practices.

Trained peers in proper tool usage, machining techniques, as well as fabrication and tolerancing.   

As a future improvement proctor: Learn how to use the Big Brother CNC Mill, spot welder, and other advanced machinery.   


**Makerspace Steward** 
Guided makerspace users in safely operating fabrication tools including laser cutters, 3D printers, and welding equipment,
fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment. Oversaw project grants and budget distribution for student projects.   

Created and customized a skateboard, an LCD alarm clock, as well as TPU footwear via the Makerspace Project Grant.   

Oversaw project grants and budget distribution, supporting student innovation while ensuring responsible and equitable use of
resources.

## Projects {#projects}
**Digital Logic Demonstration Board**  

Designed and assembled a logic-gate demonstration board using 74HC Series integrated circuits, a 555 timer, and a
potentiometer-based clock input.  

Engineered intuitive controls with input switches, banana cables and ports for adjustability, and LEDs to clearly display
output states

Delivered a durable, lecture teaching tool now used by Professor Stone for the Digital Logic and Computer Architecture
Course.
