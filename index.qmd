Hello! I am Joaquin Gonzalez-Salgado, a rising Junior Engineering major at [Harvey Mudd College](https://hmc.edu) interested in electrical and computer engineering (with appreciation for mechanical engineering.) I'm currently doing research developing an open source RISC-V verification suite for the CORE-V Wally Processor under the [Clay-Wolkin Fellowship](https://www.hmc.edu/engineering/engineering-fellowships/clay-wolkin-fellowship/). I also work alongside the USDA as a hardware/firmware engineer focused on creating low-noise analog amplifiers for monitoring insect feeding behavior as part of the [Analog Circuitry Engineering (ACE) Lab](https://www.hmc.edu/engineering/undergraduate-research-experiences/matthew-spencer-research-group/). It would be great if we could connect!
