    Created a bluetooth speaker by cutting 8 triangular pieces of plywood, and wood glueing them together in a box orientation!

    Utilized the Rockler's Speaker Set to design and assemble the speaker kit, which connects via AUX and Bluetooth! It's also portable, as it runs on a lithium ion charged battery.

    This project involved a lot of wood shop tools, including a Table Saw, Miter Saw, Planar, and much more! 

    This little project has now become a speaker I use day to day!

    __Overview:__ <br>
    Created a skateboard completely from scratch under the HMC Makerspace Grant! I previously had a skateboard, but felt I needed an upgrade
    The materials for this assembly were a sheet of plywood, bearings and tires, grip tape, and red paint, and was assembled over the course of 3 weeks. 
    Used the ShopBot (CNC Router Table) to cut out the skateboard frame. This board is now used to travel around the Harvey Mudd campus!
